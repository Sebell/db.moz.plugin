If you want to use db.moz.plugin with automated publishing 
options for `rake build` do the following:

1)
  the following cmd will install the needed tools 
  (mccoy and a patch for cmdline support).
  > rake tools
  
  at the end of the install process the tool mccoy will
  be opened.

  create a key with the name 'db.moz.plugin' and replace 
  the generated public key with the old key  
  in the tag 'updateKey' in the file 'template.install.rdf'
  
  also replace the updateUrl to point to your own host url.

2)
  alias your ssh connection to your remote server as 'db'
  so that an simple '>ssh db' will connect you to the
  server.
  on your server ('>ssh db'):
  1)
    link in your home dir 'wiki' to the place 
    where your update.rdf should be uploaded.
  2)
    and link in your home dir 'downloads' to the place
    where the .xpi files will be uploaded.
    In 'downloads' you must create the dir 'plugin'!

3)
  to build an xpi, simple type:
  '>rake build'

4)
  to publish the current build, simply type:
  '>rake publish'
  the files will be zipped and uploaded automatically
